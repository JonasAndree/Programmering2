/** 
 * A Inventory Using the ArrayList Class
 *	
 *	In this exercise you will implement a inventory for a game using the ArrayList class. 
 *	Create a file Item.java containing the definition of a class named Item that models an item 
 *	from the would. 
 *	An item has a 
 *		name, 
 *		value,
 *		weight,
 *		type, 
 *		and the quantity in the inventory. 
 *	
 *	Create Player.java as follows:
 *		- Declare and instantiate a variable inventory to be an empty ArrayList.
 *		- Create the methods needed to interact with the players inventory.
 *		- The ArrayList should not be accessible from other classes. 
 *
 *	Create a MainGame.java class that has the main method. 
 *		- with a loop where you can create and add items to a players inventory
 *		- Create a method that prints the items of the players inventory.
 *		- computes the total weight of the items in the cart (you need to create and use the getWeight and 
 *		  getQuantity, getType methods and more from the Item class).
